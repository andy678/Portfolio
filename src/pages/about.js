        <p className="text-justify text-m">I was fortunate enough to work for SGP consulting as my internship year at university. At SGP consulting I worked on a team of around 7 people building and maintaining an online housing estate agent platform. I was the co-lead backend developer working on programming the database, server requests, and functionality of the software. My time at SGP consulting was extremely useful as they gave me a lot of responsibility including managing the clients data, answering the phones, and teaching two apprentices about programming and the companyâ€™s software.</p>
